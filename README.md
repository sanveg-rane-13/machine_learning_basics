# Machine Learning Basics
Basic machine learning concepts

* Keras to implement basic Neural Network models - [Keras_basics.ipynb](Keras_basics.ipynb)
  * Basic Neural network using Keras with Tensorflow as backend
  * Neural network model to recognize images of digits - MNIST dataset (Multi layer perceptron)
  * Convolutional Neural network to recognize images of digits - MNIST dataset
  * Regression prediction using MLP - Boston housing dataset
